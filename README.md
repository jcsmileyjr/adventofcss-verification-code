# Verfication Code UI based on the Advent of JS & CSS challenge, Day 18

### The Challenge
The challenge was to build a verfication code UI based on the design given. While the design was focused on a desktop image, I have made it mobile responsive. An additional self challenge was to add testing with the React Testing Library resources.
